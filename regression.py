#In this program, you will fit a straight line between petal length and petal width. Suppose the equation is y = ax+b, find the variables a and b first. Then for a new petal width value of 5.1, find the predicted value of y.

#read csv file
#Take X as petal length
#Take y as petal width

#Split train and test with 30% and set random state as 0

#use regression from scikit learn

#find b and round off to 2 decimal places
#find a and round off to 2 decimal places

#calculate y 
new_pw = 

print(round(new_pl,2))#round off to 2 decimal places
