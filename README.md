 ## Assessment 1
 You will be working with the dataset provided - iris.csv for all the three programs. The initial starter code is given for three programs. <br>
 ## Instructions
 1. First, download these files to your machine.
 2. Write the code against the comment given in the program
 3. Edit the files and make sure you get the answers correctly.
 4. Do not change the file name 
 5. Do not add any more modules. Whatever is given is sufficient
 6. Upload the files once done. You will get a tick mark
 
 ## Questions
 1. Find the average petal width in the program __average.py__. (5)
 2. Find the range of petal width in the program __range.py__. (7)
 3. In this program __regression.py__, you will fit a straight line between petal length and petal width. Suppose the equation is y = ax+b, find the variables a and b first. Then for a new petal width value of 5.3, find the predicted value of y. (13)
